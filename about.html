    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      As a native New Yorker, I have been exposed to a vast amount of diversity
      and perspectives. Through software-engineering I want to be able to
      influence the direction of society and ensure that we, as a whole, are
      moving in the right direction. I'm willing to learn and adapt the skills
      necessary to grow my portfolio, while influencing others to do the same.
